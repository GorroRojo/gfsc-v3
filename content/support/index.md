## How we fund our work

GFSC studio works with paying clients and on grant-funded projects. As a collective we also strive to take on worthy projects that don't necessarily come with a source of funding, often those bought to our attention by members of the collective.

The money we make from our studio work firstly pays our wages and expenses, and anything left over helps fund members of the collective to work on these vital projects that do not come with a source of financial support.

Some of these projects are completed by members of the collective on an entirely voluntary basis, but many of them call for an amount of time and skill that requires reimbursement.

The small profits we make as a studio aren't enough to enable us to fully realise this important work, and so we welcome donations from those who are interested in supporting us and our upcoming projects of this nature.
