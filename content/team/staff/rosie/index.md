Rosie is a (mostly) front end developer with a background in illustration. She finds writing code immensely enjoyable and sees it as more of a craft practice than a technical job. 

Offline she is passionate about knitting, cooking, potato based snacks and things with eyes on them that should not have eyes on them.
