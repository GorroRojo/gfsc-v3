## What data do we collect?

GFSC collects anonymous analytics data

We sometimes use third party services for example [Plausable Analytics](https://plausible.io/privacy), to gather statistical data about the use of gfsc.studio. That data isn't linked to you in any way.

- anonymous plausible web stats
- email newsletter signup
- no cookies
- hmmm, anchor.fm and youtube embeds? do they count?
