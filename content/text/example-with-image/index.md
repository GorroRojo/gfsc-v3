title: Folder example with an image
---

The title in the frontmatter above will be used for the page heading

The file needs to be called index.md and the url comes from the folder name

`content/text/example-with-image/index.md -> gfsc.studio/text/example-with-image`

But we can pop an image in the folder then display it like this

![dog using a computer](Dog-using-computer.jpg)
