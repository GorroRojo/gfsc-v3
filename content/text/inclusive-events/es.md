title: The Trans Dimension - Guía para hacer eventos inclusivos
---

### Este fanzine es un acto de cuidado. Es el resultado de colaboración activa y sostenida arraigada en la idea de que no existe una sola respuesta a la pregunta de '¿cómo podemos mejorar el acceso a nuestros espacios?'

Fue producido por y para personas TTNB y discas. 

El proyecto fue liderado por __Geeks for Social Change__ en colaboración con __Sarah Joynt-Bowe__ de Prosocial Strat y fue profundamente informado por las contribuciones generosas y atentas de parte de voluntaries y seguidores de __Gendered Intelligence__ y de miembres de __Greater Manchester Coalition of Disabled People__. 

Cuando les consultamos a nuestres colaboradores por experiencias validantes o positivas que hayan tenido en eventos, lo que escuchamos fue: "En el mejor de los casos, fue mediocre." Queremos creer que esto no es por una falta de entendimiento y responsabilidad, si no por una falta de recursos y guianza. Ojalá este fanzine ayude.

## Para qué es este fanzine
Originalmente pensamos que ibamos a poder reducir la temática de accesibilidad a una serie de preguntas de sí/no sobre cosas como baños y sistemas de bucles de audio.

Cuanto más hablamos con compañeres trans y discas, más vimos que no era algo que pudiera simplificarse. Y la mayor parte del tiempo, las soluciones a estas cosas no estaban al alcance de les organizadores de eventos, (quienes muchas veces también son trans o discas).

Por ejemplo: los baños sin distincion de género no sirve de nada si no son también accesibles, si el |staff| es transfóbico, o si el evento no tiene recreos lo suficientemente largos como para que usuaries de sillas de ruedas realmente lleguen a usar los baños.

Lo único que podemos hacer es intentar mejorar las cosas. Queremos que esto sea un proceso orientado a los cuidados — lo cual significa que la gente no debería sentirse mal por no poder acomodar a todo el mundo, porque igual la accesibilidad universal es un mito. 

Este fanzine entonces apunto a ayudarte a hacer dos cosas:

1. Tener una conversación con tu grupo sobre cómo se ve la accesibilidad para vos – algunos puntos de conversación para su próxima reunión.
2. Crear una declaración de accesibilidad para compartir con el mundo – este es el punto de partida desde el cual podemos intentar crear un mundo más exlusivo, juntes.

### What people have said
#### Describe an affirming or positive experience you had at an event.

> The best I've had is mediocre. As an NB trans woman that is basically the best I can hope for – not being thrown out because I happen to have a penis and being allowed to be the only f****r there.

> People just accepting what I say my identity is. That's all. 

> When organisers volunteer as much information as they can so that people are able to make good choices. 

> Gender neutral toilets! Everyone tells you their pronouns. 

#### If you feel comfortable, describe a bad expeirence you've had at an event. 

> Anywhere I go where my name is questioned is enough to tell me whether it's inclusive. 

> Stood at a bar with a friend, and a person comes up to ask if I'm tv or cd [transvestite or cross dresser], then he asks if I'm pre or post op. I'm literally just having a drink with a friend.

#### What else do we need to know about making events trans inclusive? 

> Accessibility isn't just about the physical environment. Sometimes it's about the attitude of the people inside. 

> There has to be safe access to toilets for trans people and the guests at said event have to be able to be respectful to each other, including calling people the correct name/pronouns they actually want to be called.

> It's cool when we have event ground rules that include accepting what people say their gender is. And that they remember some of us are disabled. 

> Make bold choices with integrity that protect folks. Don't let folks get hurt just because doing so is _nice_ to the people immediately around you. 

## Part 1: Accessibility Guide 
### _"I can join in"_
#### Access is personal. There are no hard and fast rules. It's important to remember that what makes an event accessible to one person may make it impossible for another. 

All we can do is approach this with transparency and care for our communities. This document is a working and evolving guide to what makes events accessible for our community. We welcome any additions or feedback via [info@transdimension.uk](mailto:info@transdimension.uk)

### What is accessibility?

Accessibility is about sharing the labour. People in our communities are already making extra effort to access spaces every day. Our job is to lower barriers to participation for our groups and events.

We want our community to be able to participate fully. And for everyone who wishes to participate to bring themselves authentically and safely.

### What should I be thinking about?

- Don’t assume you know what access or inclusivity looks like. Remember there’s no such thing as ‘fully accessible’.
- Make it clear who the space/event is for and how you will prioritise them — transparency is the key to getting it right more often.
- Check back in with your community, often, and see if what you’re doing is working.

> Don't just say a venue is accessible – instead, say if it has or does not have different things, and then I can determine if it is accessible for me!

> [when thinking about toilets] Most importantly a disabled access toilet is one that is in use and not filled with storage, and hasn't got its assistance pull-cord tied up out of reach

### Before the event

- Produce __plain English/ easy read__ versions of event information
- __Clearly outline__ your access accommodations (don’t hide limitations)
- Clarify your __gender inclusion__ policy
- Give __multiple ways for people to communicate__ their needs (including email, form, text, and a person at the event)
- If possible, offer __funding__ (both for the attendee and their PA)
- Consider varying the __timing__ of your events (some in the day, some in the evening)
- Make __transport__ options clear (getting to and from)
- Offer __wayfinding__ support in advance (consider a video tour)
- Make it very clear if there will be __alcohol__ at the event
- Encourage your venue to invest in __staff accessibility training__ to avoid common miscommunications and oppressive treatment
- Discuss what you would do in a __medical emergency__. Some things to consider: is anyone first aid trained? Do you have a first aid kit, epi-pen, narcan, or other emergency meds on hand?
- Consider what __mental health__ scenarios might arise at your event, and what your response would be. Be aware of how some structurally disadvantaged groups’ MH crises can be mishandled by police and NHS
- Not all transphobia is the same! __Consider the ways you might be excluding__ trans men/transmasculine people, trans women/transfeminine people, and non binary people.
- Make it clear what __COVID precautions__ will be taken at the event, if any. Be aware a lack of COVID precautions will make your event inaccessible to many disabled people.
- Ask the venue if they have __detailed wheelchair accessibility guidance__ — for e.g. can they accommodate any chair, or only smaller manual ones?

### At the event

- Think about the __welcome__ your guests experience — how can you make the event structure and its access accommodations clear?
- Know and understand the __physical access__ accommodations and limitations of the space (both getting around and participating)
- Offer __remote participation__ where possible
- Make sure there are __captions__ on all videos and live streamed elements of your event
- Be mindful of __stimulation__ (sound, temperature, large groups) and offer quiet spaces
- Make sure that you offer a variety of __seating__ options including strong chairs without armrests
- Have clear __wayfinding__ (signage with a strong colour contrast) and consider sending a video tour ahead of time
- Be ready to change __lighting__, if possible
- Test and understand the __acoustics__ of the space — can you offer a quiet space?
- Offer __printed copies__ of all presentations and materials
- Encourage __name tags__ (including an option to share if you can’t read them)
- Offer comfort __breaks__ and make sure they’re long enough for someone to access the toilet and/or refreshments
- Clearly signpost the __toilets__ (we highly recommend gender neutral changing places toilets as standard)
- Know and communicate the space’s __emergency protocols__

### Some thoughts on accessibility for those who are D/deaf and hard of hearing

Inclusion and accessibility for the D/deaf community can be one of the most daunting aspects of event accessibility for organisers.

This is because, unlike some other aspects of accessibility planning (e.g. venue access), making an event accessible for D/deaf and hard of hearing people is entirely within the hands of the event organiser.

If you can manage it, BSL interpretation is the goldstandard of event accessibility for many in the D/deaf community. If it is possible for you to provide this within your budget, you should absolutely strive for it.

However, offering (and paying for) BSL interpretation can be one of the biggest ticket expenses that any event organiser will face (remember that for events longer than 60 minutes you will need at least two interpreters). Often these costs can add up to more than everything else in the event combined, so it is understandable that this may feel out of reach for many promoters.

There are some alternatives which still provide a good level of support, but may be more within the reach of smaller event hosts.

If your event is online, many of the biggest online streaming providers offer AI-captioning. It may not be perfect, but it’s better than nothing!

For live events, or online events with a bigger budget, human-typed live captions are still cheaper than BSL interpretation, but more reliable than AI captioning.

Captioning of any kind has the added bonus of supporting those who may be lightly hard of hearing, or struggle to focus on voices in crowded spaces, but don’t necessarily know BSL.

Ultimately, you should consult directly with the D/deaf community who are likely to be coming to your event, in order to ensure that you re supporting them to the best of your abilities.

### After the event
- Welcome active feedback from attendees via multiple channels
- Give opportunities to make connections via contact lists or groups to join
- Have a key follow up contact for outstanding questions or comments

## Part 2: Venue and group audit
### The following are the specific questions we ask all venues or groups who wish to be listed on The Trans Dimension site. 
#### Given our non-carceral approach to inclusion (which is often out of promoters hands), we will only flag things if an answer has not been provided — the goal is to get people to engage in the process.
We share these questions here as provocations and thinking/talking points for venues and groups who are seeking to improve their accessibility.

Fill them out, and use them as the starting point for your accessibility statement.

### Getting around
