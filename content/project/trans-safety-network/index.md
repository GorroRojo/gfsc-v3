*Trans Safety Network* are old friends of Geeks For Social Change, and weâ€™ve always been passionate supporters of the tireless, often painful work their team do to unpick both mainstream media and far right lies about the trans community. They approached us for a rebrand, and to redesign their website to make it more authoritative and robust.

This redesign helps to bring TSN's image in line with their high quality journalistic reporting. By renovating their website and image, TSN's site can now instill trust in first-time visitors. They are now much better equipped to claim their position as a trusted source for counter-narratives against the increasingly hostile world of anti-trans organised harm.

The graphic design on this project was done by frequent collaborator, [Squid](https://studiosquid.co.uk/).

If you're able, you can support Trans Safety Network [on Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/transsafetynetwork), or by sharing their articles as a means of countering anti-trans narratives. [Visit the Trans Safety Network's website.](https://transsafety.network/)
