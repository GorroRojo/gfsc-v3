In this academic paper first published in **Information, Communication & Society** in 2020, Stefan and Kim explore how a ‘capability approach’ to information technology in neighbourhoods with low social capital can create embedded and sustainable Community Technology Partnerships (CTPs). These can connect residents and institutions together, reducing barriers to social participation and collaborative action. 

The paper also explores the initial implementation and early success and potential of our PlaceCal platform, with insight into its potential future, and challenges it may face.
